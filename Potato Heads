# Description: This project attempts to start the production of two potatoheads at a random centerpoint, given parameters "centerx" and "centery" (the "x" and "y" coordinates). The craft of this project appears through the following functions: "draw_eyes," "draw_hair," and "draw_mouth." These functions attempt to recreate eyes, hair, mouths, and other facial features depending on the center of the potatohead circle, meaning that the facial features will align with the random given center of the potatoheads.
